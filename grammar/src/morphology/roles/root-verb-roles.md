# Root Verb roles

A sentence may contain only one root verb, or “main verb”, and it is always the first word of the sentence. When a root verb occurs in a stream of words, it signals that a new sentence begins at that position.

A root verb alone is sufficient as a complete sentence. A root verb has a set of core complements specified by its stem, each being associated with a grammatical case. When any of these core complements is not explicitly present, it is covertly existentially quantified, i.e. it's set to “something or somebody”.  
  
There are several different Role prefixes that create root verbs; they further show additional information, namely the illocution (speech act) of the sentence, and if that illocution is the ‘Assertive’, then they also indicate Evidentiality, i.e. the kind of evidence that is the basis for the claim being made with the utterance.  
The Illocution indicates whether the sentence is an assertion (a description of what the speaker thinks is reality), a question, a command, a request, a performative/declarative act, and so on.  
  
Below is a list of the possible root verb prefixes. 
  
## Assertive illocution
The assertive illocution expresses the speech act of informing the addressee of what the speaker deem as true or likely true in their mental model of the world. It does not imply (nor deny) a desire to convince the addressee.
The prefix for the assertive illocution further declines for a variety of possible *evidentialities*, which indicate the mean by which the asserted information was obtained. The assertive illocution is the only one to sport evidentiality marking, thus the evidentiality prefixes all also indicate that the illocution is assertive. The list of evidentiality prefixes is shown below:

| Form | Name | Gloss | Use |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| **aı-** | Unspecified | ASR | Assertion of unspecified evidentiality. |
| **oı-** | Multievidential | MUL | Imformation confirmed from multiple different independent sources of information. |
| **a-** | Inferential | NFR | Inference from a combination of information from several sources. |
| **ı-** | Sensorial | SEN | Sensory information from current perception, including metacognition. |
| **eo-** | Intuitive | ITU | Intuition. |
| **u-** | Recollective | REC | Recollection, memory of past experiences (but not memorized encyclopedic facts, for which Reportives or Epistemic should be used). |
| **ıwa-** | Reconstitutive | RCS | Information obtained from sensorial recordings made by external devices (photographic or video camera, sound recorders…). |
| **o-** | Reportive | REP | Information obtained via communication: report, hearsay, second-hand information. |

## Non-assertive illocutions

| Form | Name | Gloss | Use |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| **ï-** | Performative | PFM | Utterance true merely by virtue of being uttered. |
| **ma-** | Verificative | VRF | Request of confirmation, “… isn't it?”. | 
| **mı-** | Polar Interrogative | PQ⁓PI | Yes-no question. |
| **mu-** | Content Interrogative | CQ⁓CI | “wh” question (“what?”, “who?”, “which?”, “when?”, “where?”, “how”? “why?”, etc.). |
| **maı-** | Rethorical Polar Interrogative. | RPQ⁓RPI | |
| **mao-** | Rethorical Content Interrogative. | RCQ⁓RCI | |
| **kʰa-** | Directive | DIR | Order with implied threat, negative consequences if unfulfilled. |
| **kʰo-** | Requestive | REQ | Request with implied disappointment if unfulfilled. |

| **yea-** | Permissive | PRM | Expression of permission. |
| **yao-** | Oblative | OBLT | Disinterested offers (*“I'm available for…”*, *“if you're interested…”*, *“if you want…”*). |

The content interrogative illocutions go hand-in-hand with the lambda pronominal extension ⟪-tʼ◈-⟫ (glossed as `LBD`), which plays here the role of the content interrogative pronoun “what”. There is do distinct pronoun for “who”.

Note: Whilst there's a prefix for granting permission, ⟪kʰaı-⟫, there's no dedicated one for prohibition, for that latter is expressed with negative imperatives instead:
